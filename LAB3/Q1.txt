The output of the program displays the wrong value because the datatype being used to hold/store that value does not have the capacity to hold such a large number. In order to make this work, the data type would need to be changed to long or double with the format specifier used in the printf function also being modified accordingly. These datatypes are capable of holding larger values and therefore will represent the specified number accurately.
